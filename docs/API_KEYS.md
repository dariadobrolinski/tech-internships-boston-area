# API Keys Setup Guide

This guide will help you obtain and configure API keys for the job search script.

## Overview

The script works with three data sources:
1. **Greenhouse/Lever** - No API keys needed! ‚úÖ
2. **Adzuna** - Optional, for broader job search
3. **SERP API** - Optional, for discovering new companies

> **Note**: The script works great with just Greenhouse/Lever (no API keys needed). The other sources are optional enhancements.

## üìù Setting Up Your .env File

1. **Create .env file** in the project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. **Add your keys** (use nano, vim, or any text editor):
   ```bash
   # Adzuna (optional)
   ADZUNA_APP_ID=your_adzuna_app_id
   ADZUNA_APP_KEY=your_adzuna_app_key

   # SERP API (optional)
   SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
   ```

3. **Save and close** the file

4. **Verify** it's in .gitignore:
   ```bash
   cat .gitignore | grep .env
   ```
   Should show `.env` (so you don't accidentally commit your keys!)

## üß™ Testing Your API Keys

### Test Adzuna
```bash
python3 scripts/adzuna_report.py --location "Boston, MA"
```

If successful, you'll see:
```
Found X results from Adzuna.
README.md: Added Y new jobs, skipped Z duplicates.
```

### Test SERP API
```bash
python3 scripts/discover_slugs.py --max 10
```

If successful, you'll see:
```
Greenhouse slugs: [...]
Lever slugs: [...]
Updated config/companies.yml with X total companies.
```

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### "Set ADZUNA_APP_ID and ADZUNA_APP_KEY in your environment"
**Problem**: API keys not found

**Solutions**:
1. Check `.env` file exists in the project root
2. Check keys are spelled correctly (no spaces)
3. Try running with keys directly:
   ```bash
   ADZUNA_APP_ID=xxx ADZUNA_APP_KEY=yyy ./run_all.sh
   ```

### "401 Unauthorized" or "403 Forbidden"
**Problem**: Invalid API keys

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check you copied the full key (no truncation)
2. Regenerate keys on the provider's website
3. Check if you've exceeded rate limits

### "400 Bad Request" from Adzuna
**Problem**: Invalid search query

**Solutions**:
1. This is usually a query syntax issue
2. Try simplifying the search terms
3. Check that the script is using double quotes (`"`) not single quotes (`'`) in the query

### "Too Many Requests" (429 error)
**Problem**: Hit rate limit

**Solutions**:
1. Wait until next month (free tier resets)
2. Reduce search frequency
3. For SERP: Use `--max 10` instead of default 50
4. Consider upgrading to paid tier if needed

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Security
- ‚úÖ **Never** commit `.env` to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Keep your keys private
- ‚úÖ Regenerate keys if accidentally exposed
- ‚ùå Don't share keys in issues or PRs

### Cost Management
- Use the free tiers - they're sufficient for personal use
- Run Adzuna searches daily (only 30 calls/month)
- Run SERP discovery weekly (saves API calls)
- Monitor your usage on provider dashboards

### Optimization
- **Adzuna**: Adjust `--max-days-old` to filter recent postings only
- **SERP**: Use `--max 20` for fewer API calls
- Both can be disabled by not setting the keys
